# Overview
This project is an effort to keep track of my progress with my own personal goals and combine it with what i've learned about using threeJS. The idea is that there are supposed to be 2 NPC's the player can interact with, one of which will allow you to add new goals. The other one will allow to complete a goal and choose a new ability/upgrade abilities. Then there will be different bosses to try to defeat and as you level up, the bosses get more difficult and the maps will get more complicated. Sort of inspired by world of warcraft, but on a VERY simplified level. 

I plan on making this a React ThreeJS game using CannonJS. Currently i am reorganizing my code to be more efficient by creating different classes and actually using object oriented programming. The next step is converting it to a React App once i get my code working with the new structure
