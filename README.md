# Overview
This project is an effort to keep track of my progress with my own personal goals and combine it with what i've learned about using threeJS. The idea is that there are supposed to be 2 NPC's the player can interact with, one of which will allow you to add new goals. The other one will allow to complete a goal and choose a new ability/upgrade abilities. Then there will be different bosses to try to defeat and as you level up, the bosses get more difficult and the maps will get more complicated. Sort of inspired by world of warcraft, but on a VERY simplified level. 

I plan on making this a React ThreeJS game using CannonJS. Currently i have the basic abilities of the player, was able to create a healthbar and generate text using threejs which i hadn't implemented in my first ThreeJS attempt at a game.
